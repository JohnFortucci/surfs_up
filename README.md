## Introduction
  
The purpose of this analysis is to take the temperature data collected from multiple monitoring stations and extract the temperature data for the months of June and December.
  
For each of the months generate summary statistics based on the data extracted.

Prepare a report analysing each of the months data and comparing the two sets of data.

## Results comparison

+ Average temperatures comparison
  + The difference between the average temperatures is approximately 4 Degrees , this is not a significant change between the months of June and December.

+ Mininum temperatures comparison
  + The difference between the minimum temperatures is 8 Degrees , this would indicate that there are some days where the temperature in December is quite cold.

+ Maximun temperature comparison
  + The difference between the maximun temperatures is 2 Degrees , this is not significant , and indicates that the maximum temperature is consistent across the two months.
